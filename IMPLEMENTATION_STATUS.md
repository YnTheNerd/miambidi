   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Authentication:**
   - Visit http://localhost:5173
   - Try creating a new account
   - Test Google sign-in (requires Firebase setup)
   - Test login with existing account

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Firebase Console Setup Required** - App will work locally but needs Firebase services enabled
- **Google Auth** - Requires Firebase Authentication setup
- **Real-time Features** - Will work once Firestore is enabled
- **Security Rules** - Must be applied for production use

## 🎉 **Achievement Summary**

✅ **Complete authentication system with family management**
✅ **Professional, responsive UI with Material-UI**
✅ **Real-time data synchronization architecture**
